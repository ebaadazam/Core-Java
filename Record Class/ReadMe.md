Records are a special kind of Java class introduced in Java 14 designed to model data carriers. Records simplify the task of writing immutable data classes by automatically generating boilerplate code such as getters, equals(), hashCode(), and toString() methods. This feature helps to avoid verbose code and focus on the data the class is meant to represent.</br>

A private final field is created.<br>
A public constructor is generated.<br>
A public method (getter) is generated with the same name as the field.<br>
The equals(), hashCode(), and toString() methods are automatically implemented based on the record's components.<br>

<b>Key Characteristics</b><br>
Immutability:<br> 
Record components are implicitly final, meaning their values are assigned once upon object creation and cannot change afterward.<br>

Not Meant for Mutable Data:<br>
Records are designed to be transparent carriers for immutable data. If you need mutable fields or extensive behavior, a regular class might be more appropriate.<br>

Conciseness:<br>
Records reduce the need for boilerplate code, making your data definitions more readable and concise.<br>

Automatic equals(), hashCode(), and toString():<br>
These methods are generated based on the record components, ensuring a consistent and logical behavior for data comparison, hash coding, and representation as a string.<br>

Customization:<br>
You can define static methods, static fields, instance methods, and constructors within a record body. However, the primary constructor is the canonical constructor generated by default, and it cannot be modified directly. You can, though, add additional constructors that delegate to the canonical constructor.<br>

<b>Limitations and Restrictions</b><br>
Extends:<br>
Records cannot extend any other class because they implicitly extend the java.lang.Record class.<br>
Mutable State:<br>
You cannot declare instance fields that are not part of the record components. All data that a record carries must be declared in the record header.<br>
Subclassing:<br>Records are implicitly final, so you cannot subclass them.<br>
