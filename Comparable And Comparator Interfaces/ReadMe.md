The main differences between Comparable and Comparator in Java revolve around their purpose, usage, and implementation. Both are interfaces used for comparing objects, but they are used in different scenarios. Here’s a breakdown of the key differences:

1. Package:</br>
Comparable is in the java.lang package.</br>
Comparator is in the java.util package.</br>

4. Method to Implement:</br>
Comparable requires the implementation of the compareTo method.</br>
Comparator requires the implementation of the compare method.</br>

5. Purpose and Usage:</br>
Comparable is used to provide a single, natural sorting order for objects of a class. When a class implements Comparable, it suggests that objects of this class have a natural order. For example, you might decide that Employee objects should be ordered by their ID by default.</br>
Comparator is used when you need to define multiple different ways to compare objects or if you want to sort objects based on different attributes without changing the class’s implementation. It's also useful for classes that you do not control (e.g., third-party or standard library classes).</br>

6. Implementation:</br>
Comparable is implemented by the class of objects that need to be compared. This means the class itself defines its natural comparison method.</br>
Comparator is implemented by a separate class when you want to compare objects of another class, especially useful for defining multiple different comparison strategies.</br>

7. Method Signature:</br>
Comparable’s compareTo method: int compareTo(T o)</br>
Comparator’s compare method: int compare(T o1, T o2)</br>

8. Flexibility:</br>
Comparable provides a single way to compare objects, which can be a limitation if you need multiple sorting criteria.</br>
Comparator allows for greater flexibility by enabling you to create as many different comparison methods as you need.</br>

9. Use Case Scenario:</br>
Comparable is used when sorting elements in collections like Arrays.sort() or Collections.sort() when a single sorting sequence is needed.</br>
Comparator is used when sorting with Collections.sort() or Arrays.sort() if you need specific sorting order(s) that differ from the natural order, or when sorting objects based on multiple criteria.</br>
