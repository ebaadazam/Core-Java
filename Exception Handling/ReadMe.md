The Exception Handling in Java is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, IndexOutOfBoundsException, ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc. so that the normal flow of the application can be maintained. The core advantage of exception handling is to maintain the normal flow of the application. Suppose there are 10 statements in a Java program and an exception occurs at statement 5; the rest of the code will not be executed, i.e., statements 6 to 10 will not be executed. However, when we perform exception handling, the rest of the statements will be executed. That is why we use exception handling in Java.<br>
The java.lang.Throwable class is the root class of Java Exception hierarchy inherited by two subclasses: <b>Exception</b> and <b>Error</b>.<br>
